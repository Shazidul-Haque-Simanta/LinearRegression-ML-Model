Linear Regression Model for Predicting Scores Based on Practicing Hours
Overview
This project showcases a simple yet effective machine learning model using linear regression to predict scores based on practicing hours. The model was developed using Python and several essential libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named Model.csv.

#Data Preparation
Reading Data:
The data is read from a CSV file using Pandas:

python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv("Model.csv")
Initial Data Exploration:
Displaying the first 7 rows of the dataset and checking for any missing values:

python
Copy code
df.head(7)
df.isnull().sum()
Cleaning Data:
Removing rows with null values to ensure the dataset is clean:

python
Copy code
df_cleaned = df.dropna()
df_cleaned.head(7)
Data Visualization
A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between practicing hours and scores:

python
Copy code
plt.scatter(df['Practising hour (X)'], df['Score(Y)'])
plt.xlabel('Practicing hour (X)')
plt.ylabel('Score (Y)')
plt.title('Scatter Diagram')
plt.show()
Model Training
Preparing Data for Training:
Separating the features and the target variable:

python
Copy code
x = df_cleaned.drop('Score(Y)', axis=1)
y = df_cleaned[['Score(Y)']]
Applying Linear Regression:
Using Scikit-Learn's LinearRegression to create and train the model:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(x, y)
Model Coefficients
Calculating the intercept (c) and the coefficient (m) of the linear regression model:

python
Copy code
c = reg.intercept_
m = reg.coef_
Predictions
Making predictions using the trained model, including a manual prediction and one using the model's predict method:

python
Copy code
# Manual calculation
predicted_score = m * 15 + c

# Using the model
predicted_score_model = reg.predict([[15]])
Adding the predicted values to the cleaned dataset:

python
Copy code
df_cleaned['Predicted Value (Score)'] = reg.predict(x)
Visualization of Predictions
Plotting the regression line along with the mean values of x and y:

python
Copy code
plt.scatter(x.mean(), y.mean(), color='red')
plt.plot(x, reg.predict(x))
plt.xlabel('Practicing hour (X)')
plt.ylabel('Score (Y)')
plt.title('Regression Line')
plt.show()
