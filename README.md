# LinearRegression-ML-Model

Linear Regression Model for Predicting Scores Based on Practicing Hours
# Overview:
This project showcases a simple yet effective machine learning model using linear regression to predict scores based on practicing hours. The model was developed using Python and several essential libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named Model.csv.

# Data Preparation
Reading Data:
The data is read from a CSV file using Pandas:

# Manual calculation
predicted_score = m * x + c

# Using the model
predicted_score_model = reg.predict([[x]])

# Repository Structure
   # Model.csv: The dataset containing practicing hours and scores.
   # linear_regression_model.py: The Python script containing all the code for data preparation, visualization, model training, and prediction.
   # README.md: This file, providing an overview and detailed description of the project.
# How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Shazidul-Haque-Simanta/linear-regression-model.git

# Navigate to the project directory:

cd linear-regression-model

# Install the required dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

# Run the Python script:
python linear_regression_model.py

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the basics of linear regression using Python and essential data science libraries. It is a good starting point for understanding the relationship between two variables and predicting outcomes based on historical data.
